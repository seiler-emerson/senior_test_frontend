## **Challenge**

Minimum technologies that must be used:
- PostgreSQL database
- Java 8+
- JPA
- REST with JSON

Test requirements:
 - A register must be developed (Create/Read/Update/Delete/List) for the following entities: product/service, order, and order items.
 - All entities must have a unique ID of type UUID
 - In the product/service registration, there must be an indication to differentiate a product from a service.
 - It must be possible to apply a percentage discount on the order, but only for the items that are product (not service); the discount will be on the total value of the products.

Acceptance criteria:
 - The test must be delivered in full (all items solved)
 - The code cannot have compilation errors.
 - There must be minimal documentation of how to execute the project and its functionalities.

## **🔀 Application Sections**
---
## 📦&nbsp; Product / Service

In the products and services section are related the ProductService class where are the attributes and encapsulation for handling products and services, the Controller ProductServiceController class containing the CRUD manipulation methods and the IProductServiceRepository interface inheriting the JpaRepository.
For the classification of the type of registered item (Product/Service) and the unit of measure of the item, two Enuns were created to be used.
The identification key generated for each item was of type UUID.
The controller still uses the MaturityLevel3 Class that inherits from ItemLevel3 to structure a maturity level 3 API.

<br>

## 🧾&nbsp; Order

In the order section are related the Order class where are the attributes and encapsulation for order manipulation, the OderController class containing the CRUD manipulation methods and the IOrderRepository interface inheriting the JpaRepository.
The identification key generated for each item was of type UUID.
The controller still uses the MaturityLevel3 Class that inherits from ItemLevel3 to structure a maturity level 3 API.

<br>

## 🧾&nbsp; OrderItens

In the order items section, the OrderItens class is listed, where are the attributes and encapsulation for handling the products and services of the order, the OderItensController class containing the CRUD manipulation methods and the IOrderRepository interface inheriting the JpaRepository.
The identification key generated for each item was of type UUID.
The controller still uses the MaturityLevel3 Class that inherits from ItemLevel3 to structure a maturity level 3 API.

5. Make a project copy to your machine:
    - git clone [https://github.com/seiler-emerson/senior_test_backend](https://github.com/seiler-emerson/senior_test_backend.git)
    - Or a direct download from the page [HERE](https://github.com/seiler-emerson/senior_test_backend.git).
6. Import the project into your Spring Tools Suite.
    - File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Next -> Browse -> Select Downloaded Project -> Finish
7. A change to the application.properties file is required.
    - It is necessary to define your bank address, username and password.
    - By default these are the data, just when installing the database enter the same data for username and password (

    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    pring.datasource.password=senior123
    ````

## **PostgreeSql**
